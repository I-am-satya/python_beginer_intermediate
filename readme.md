Hello Everyone,

I'm Satya Venkat, a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience in developing Python scripts to automate manual or complex tasks.

I am enthusiastic and determined, and I strongly believe that learning happens best through hands-on experience.

This repository contains a collection of interview practice questions, including:
âœ… Real-time interview questions I have faced in various technical rounds.
âœ… Practice questions from valuable resources, such as those shared by Bosscoders Academy on LinkedIn.
âœ… General theoretical and coding questions commonly asked in interviews.

I encourage contributions! Feel free to add more practice questions and share your interview experiences to help others prepare better.

Thank you for your support! ðŸš€
